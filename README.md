# REPORT ON CREDITCARD FRAUD DETECTION ANALYSIS
# PROJECT PREVIEW
 The credit card fraud detection project aims to accurately identify fraudulent transactions within a highly imbalanced dataset containing legitimate (valid) transactions and fraud transactions, where only a small fraction of transactions is fraudulent. The dataset has 284, 807 transactions with only 492 labeled as fraud (about 0.17%) making it highly imbalanced.
