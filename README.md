# CREDITCARD-FRAUD-DETECTION-
# REPORT ON CREDITCARD FRAUD DETECTION ANALYSIS
# PROJECT PREVIEW
 The credit card fraud detection project aims to accurately identify fraudulent transactions within a highly imbalanced dataset containing legitimate (valid) transactions and fraud transactions, where only a small fraction of transactions is fraudulent. The dataset has 284, 807 transactions with only 492 labeled as fraud (about 0.17%) making it highly imbalanced.
 
# STEPS INVOLVED;

# STEP 1. IMPORTING NECESSARY LIBRARIES: 
 Here, the necessary libraries for data handling, Visualization and modelling were imported.

# STEP2. LOADING THE DATA/DATA SOURCES:  
 The dataset was loaded in an Excel Spreadsheet and its structure examined. The dataset contains 284,807 total transactions with 31 Features including:
1. Column 1: Time; This shows how many seconds have passed since the first transactions in the dataset.
2.	Column 2-28: V1-V28; These are special features created to hide sensitive information about the original data.
3.	Column 29: Amount; This indicates transaction amount.
4.	Column 30: Class: Target/Response Variables (0 for Normal(valid) transactions, 1 for fraudulent transactions).

# STEP 3. TOOLS USED:
 The following tools were used to analyze the dataset;
1. Microsoft Excel
2.	SQL
3.	Power Bi Desktop

# STEP 4: DATA CLEANING/PROCESSING
# DATA CLEANING: 
The dataset was cleaned by selecting the wanted attributes or variables, excluding null rows and treating outliers, if necessary, in addition to transforming data types to the wanted type, although the dataset didnâ€™t need to go through all the alterations as there was no merging needed as well.
